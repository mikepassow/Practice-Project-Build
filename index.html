I seperated from active duty service in the U.S. Coast Guard last December (2018) and had no idea what I was gonna do with my life. I was hoping that the Coast Guard would give me a sense of direction in the civilian job market but sadly, it didnt. BUT NO WORRIES! YA BOY LEARNED SOME CODE! This stuff is awesome, but very challenging.</p>
