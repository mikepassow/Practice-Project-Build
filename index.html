I seperated from active duty service in the U.S. Coast Guard last December (2018) and had no idea what I was gonna do with my life. I was hoping that the Coast Guard would give me a sense of direction in the civilian job market but sadly, it didnt. BUT NO WORRIES! I LEARNED SOME CODE! This stuff is awesome, but very challenging.</p> 
    <p>Currently I am a student at Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp. As I creep closer to gradutaion I think more and more about the job market and if someone is going to hire me cause I dont have a degree. Its a tough competetive field with alot of smart people in it. Something I dont know much about, haha! I believe i'll get a chance with a nice company though. I know I have the personality to teach and sell. Now I need to really understand the fundamentals of Software Engineering. Like how you can design really cool looking pages with ONLY HTML AND CSS! Or how a little bit of Javascript adds all these cool features</p>
